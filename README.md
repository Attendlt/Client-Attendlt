Attendlt is a facial recognition-based attendance system web app to mark the attendance of employees/students during work from home culture. It uses the "68 Point Face Landmark Detection Models" and "a ResNet-34 like architecture" to detect and recognize the faces of employees automatically and mark their attendance.
